  "body": "# xlunch\r\nGraphical app launcher for X, using pure Xlib and Imlib2. It allows you to run a program by clicking its icon. Alternatively\r\nyou can just type any command using your keyboard. UTF8 is supported.\r\nThe Run commandline also works as a filter for the icons, as long as the title or command matches, icon is visible.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tomas-M/xlunch/Screenshot/screenshot.png \"Screenshot\")\r\n\r\n**Available Modes**\r\n\r\n- One time launcher mode - this is default mode. In this mode, the launcher\r\n    opens as a fullscreen application, and offers screen with icons to select\r\n    application to run, plus commandline which serves as a filter for\r\n    the icons at the same time. Running any app or command ends the launcher.\r\n- Kiosk mode - in this mode, the Run comand is disabled, thus user cannot\r\n    type any command and the command line is not displayed in the launcher.\r\n    User can only select icons to run with arrow keys (if launcher has focus).\r\n    Input focus is not affected by this mode at all.\r\n- Fork mode - in this mode, the commands or apps are started as new process\r\n    and the launcher keeps running. Input focus is not affected by this mode at all.\r\n    Note that unless you combine fork mode with desktop mode (see below),\r\n    your forked application window will most likely end up behind the launcher\r\n    so it will look like nothing was started.\r\n- Desktop mode - in this mode, the launcher sends itself to lowest position,\r\n    so all other windows are above it. This emulates desktop with icons.\r\n    Input focus is affected in the way that the launcher never gets focus,\r\n    so even if kiosk mode is disabled, user cannot use keyboard to use the launcher.\r\n    Only mouse will work.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to combine all modes together. Keep in mind that if you use\r\ndesktop mode while you are running some other desktop already, you may\r\nend up with launcher even under your other desktop, thus it may be inaccessible.\r\nThe desktop mode is intended only for users without other desktop.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tomas-M/xlunch/Screenshot/screenshot2.png \"Screenshot\")\r\n\r\n\r\n**Commandline options:**\r\n\r\n    -k         kiosk mode, disable Run prompt, allow user to only run by icon\r\n    -d         desktop mode, keep the launcher lowest (behind other windows)\r\n    -v         fork mode, keep running after executing a program\r\n    \r\n    -r         use root window's background image\r\n               Fails if your root window has no image set\r\n    -g [file]  Image to set as background (jpg/png)\r\n    -m [i]     margin (integer) specifies margin in pixels between icons\r\n    -p [i]     padding (integer) specifies padding inside icons in pixels\r\n    -b [i]     border (integer) specifies spacing border size in pixels\r\n    -i [i]     icon size (integer) in pixels\r\n    -c [file]  path to config file which describes titles, icons and commands\r\n    -n         Disable fullscreen\r\n    -t [i]     Top position (integer) in pixels for the Run commandline\r\n    -x [text]  string to display instead of 'Run: '\r\n    -f [name]  font name including size after slash, for example: DejaVuSans/10\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Format of config file (default is /etc/xlunch/icons.conf) is:**\r\n\r\n    title;icon_path;cmd\r\n    title;icon_path;cmd\r\n    title;icon_path;cmd\r\n    title;icon_path;cmd\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compile:**\r\n\r\n    gcc xlunch.c -o xlunch -lImlib2 -lX11 -lXcursor\r\n\r\n\r\nConfig file can be generated by ./genconf > /etc/xlunch/icons.conf\r\n\r\nBest practice is when you have a keyboard shortcut to start xlunch, such as Alt+F2\r\nOr have a button in taskbar to run it.\r\n\r\nTo start xlunch on i3wm for example, add this line to ~/.i3/config:\r\n\r\n    bindsym $mod+F2 exec /usr/bin/xlunch\r\n ",
